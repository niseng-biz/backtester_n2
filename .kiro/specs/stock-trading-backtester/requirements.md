# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive stock trading strategy backtester built in Python. The system is designed with future automated trading bot implementation in mind, featuring a modular architecture with three core components: data acquisition from CSV sources, strategy execution with market and limit orders, and comprehensive backtesting analysis including profit factor calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to load historical stock price data from CSV files, so that I can backtest my trading strategies against real market data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CSV file path is provided THEN the system SHALL load candlestick data (OHLCV) successfully
2. WHEN the CSV contains standard columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the data format
3. WHEN invalid or missing data is encountered THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages
4. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL convert dates to proper datetime objects and sort chronologically
5. IF the CSV file is not found THEN the system SHALL raise a FileNotFoundError with descriptive message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want to implement custom trading strategies that can generate buy/sell signals, so that I can test different algorithmic approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a strategy is defined THEN it SHALL inherit from a base Strategy class with standardized interface
2. WHEN market data is provided to a strategy THEN it SHALL generate trading signals (BUY, SELL, HOLD)
3. WHEN generating signals THEN the strategy SHALL support both market orders and limit orders
4. WHEN a strategy processes data THEN it SHALL have access to current and historical price information
5. IF insufficient data is available THEN the strategy SHALL handle the condition without crashing
6. WHEN multiple strategies are implemented THEN they SHALL be easily interchangeable within the backtester

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to execute different order types (market and limit orders), so that I can simulate realistic trading conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a market order is placed THEN it SHALL execute immediately at the current market price
2. WHEN a limit order is placed THEN it SHALL only execute when the target price is reached
3. WHEN a buy limit order is active THEN it SHALL execute when the low price touches or goes below the limit price
4. WHEN a sell limit order is active THEN it SHALL execute when the high price touches or goes above the limit price
5. WHEN an order is executed THEN the system SHALL record the execution price, timestamp, and order type
6. WHEN insufficient funds are available THEN the system SHALL reject the order and log the rejection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want comprehensive backtesting results including profit factor and other key metrics, so that I can evaluate strategy performance objectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backtest completes THEN the system SHALL calculate total return percentage
2. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL calculate profit factor (gross profit / gross loss)
3. WHEN backtesting finishes THEN the system SHALL provide win rate (winning trades / total trades)
4. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL show maximum drawdown percentage
5. WHEN performance is calculated THEN the system SHALL include Sharpe ratio if risk-free rate is provided
6. WHEN multiple trades occur THEN the system SHALL track individual trade P&L and cumulative performance
7. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL be formatted in a clear, readable manner

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a modular design that separates data acquisition, strategy logic, and backtesting execution, so that components can be developed and tested independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN it SHALL have distinct modules for DataReader, Strategy, and Backtester
2. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces and data contracts
3. WHEN a new data source is needed THEN it SHALL be addable without modifying existing strategy or backtester code
4. WHEN a new strategy is implemented THEN it SHALL integrate without changes to data reader or backtester
5. WHEN the backtester runs THEN it SHALL coordinate between data reader and strategy components seamlessly
6. IF any component fails THEN the error SHALL be isolated and not crash the entire system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for automated trading, I want the backtester architecture to support future live trading integration, so that strategies can be deployed with minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategies are implemented THEN they SHALL use interfaces compatible with live trading APIs
2. WHEN order management is designed THEN it SHALL support the same order types used in live trading
3. WHEN data structures are defined THEN they SHALL match common trading platform data formats
4. WHEN the system processes orders THEN it SHALL use realistic execution assumptions (slippage, fees)
5. WHEN backtesting runs THEN it SHALL simulate market conditions as closely as possible to live trading
6. IF live trading integration is added later THEN strategy code SHALL require minimal modifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want the backtester to track position sizing and portfolio value over time, so that I can assess risk exposure and capital utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL track current position size and direction
2. WHEN portfolio value changes THEN the system SHALL maintain a running balance including cash and positions
3. WHEN positions are opened THEN the system SHALL calculate position value based on current market price
4. WHEN the backtest runs THEN it SHALL prevent over-leveraging beyond available capital
5. WHEN results are generated THEN they SHALL include position history and portfolio value timeline
6. IF margin requirements apply THEN the system SHALL enforce position limits based on available margin
7. WHEN multiple positions are held THEN the system SHALL support up to 5 concurrent positions per strategy
8. WHEN positions are managed THEN each position SHALL be tracked independently with separate entry/exit records

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a trader, I want visual representations of my backtesting results including entry/exit points and performance curves, so that I can better understand strategy behavior and performance patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backtest completes THEN the system SHALL generate a price chart with entry and exit points marked
2. WHEN trades are executed THEN entry signals SHALL be displayed as gray triangular markers (up for buy, down for sell)
3. WHEN trades are closed THEN exit signals SHALL be displayed as colored triangular markers (green for profit, red for loss)
4. WHEN entry and exit points exist THEN they SHALL be connected with dotted lines to show trade relationships
5. WHEN backtesting finishes THEN the system SHALL display an equity curve showing portfolio value over time
6. WHEN performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL show drawdown periods highlighted on the equity curve
7. WHEN results are visualized THEN charts SHALL include proper labels, legends, and formatting
8. WHEN multiple strategies are compared THEN the system SHALL support overlaying multiple equity curves
9. WHEN charts are generated THEN they SHALL be saveable as image files for reporting purposes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want backtesting results and trade history to be organized in dedicated folders, so that I can easily manage and archive multiple backtest runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backtest completes THEN the system SHALL create a 'test_results' folder if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN backtest results are saved THEN JSON files SHALL be stored in the 'test_results' folder
3. WHEN trade history is exported THEN CSV files SHALL be stored in the 'test_results' folder
4. WHEN multiple backtests are run THEN each result SHALL have a unique timestamp-based filename
5. WHEN the test_results folder is accessed THEN it SHALL contain only backtest-related files
6. IF the test_results folder cannot be created THEN the system SHALL fall back to the current directory with a warning

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to implement advanced strategies that can hold multiple positions simultaneously, so that I can test complex trading approaches like dollar-cost averaging and pyramid strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a strategy generates multiple signals THEN the system SHALL support opening up to 5 concurrent positions
2. WHEN multiple positions are held THEN each position SHALL be tracked independently with unique identifiers
3. WHEN positions are opened THEN the system SHALL enforce position limits and risk management rules
4. WHEN a position is closed THEN only that specific position SHALL be affected, not other open positions
5. WHEN calculating performance THEN the system SHALL aggregate P&L across all positions correctly
6. WHEN visualizing results THEN each position's entry and exit points SHALL be displayed distinctly
7. WHEN implementing RSI-based strategies THEN the system SHALL support dollar-cost averaging approaches

### Requirement 11
